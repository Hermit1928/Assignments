			<p class="content">Chicken fried rice
Chicken fried rice is a classic. It’s easy to customize with your favorite vegetables, such as pea pods, carrots, garlic, and diced chicken. Add some cold rice.

Cauliflower fried rice
Using riced cauliflower instead of rice cuts down on carbs and adds extra vegetables. The garlic-chili sauce and fresh garlic provide a robust, warm flavor.

Shrimp fried rice
This shrimp-fried rice is simple enough for a weeknight meal. It uses ready-to-serve rice, fresh shrimp, soy sauce, and frozen vegetables prepared in a wok. It’s topped with scrambled eggs.</p>

			<p class="s3">Shushi</p>

Sashimi
Fish or shellfish served alone (no rice). This is best for people who really love to taste the fish or shellfish since it comes with nothing else

Maki
